< INSERT A PROJECT NAME HERE ( I couldn't think of any good name >

This is a short note for the project members for the safety of the project :
1. Don't push anything to master branch.
2. Create a new branch and ammend your changes.
3. Once they are reviewd by everyone merge it with master branch
4. Profit
